## 🚀 Overview

BatteryFi empowers users to:

- Understand when electricity is cheapest or under highest demand  
- Automatically schedule appliance usage with predictive insights  
- Participate in “energy tasks” that reduce grid stress  
- Earn **Boltz tokens** for sustainable behavior  
- Track real-time and historical energy savings  
- Join large-scale sustainability initiatives even without hardware upgrades  

The system works even **without physical batteries**. AI analyzes energy patterns and generates optimal energy-saving tasks tailored to the user.
